                        <h2>POVERTY AND HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IN UNITED STATES, IS IT RELATED?</h2>
                        <p><h5>Kansas:</h5>New Hampshire is having least poverty (9.2%) in US for 2014 and Massachusetts ranks first 
                            for Health care coverage (96.4% of population have health care), according to a report by U.S. Census Bureau 
                            and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The study was conducted to find a correlation between 
                            lack of health care coverage and poverty on the data from all the 50 states and Washington D.C.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Texas comes last in terms of health care coverage, approx. 25% of population in Texas do not have a health 
                            care plan, followed by Georgia (21%) and Mississippi (18.8%). Interestingly, Mississippi also have worst poverty levels 
                            in all of US, 21.5% of population is suffering from poverty. Other states having higher poverty numbers are 
                            New Mexico (21.3%) and Louisiana (18.7%). Kansas is doing pretty good compared to other states with lower 
                            poverty levels (13.6%) and good percentage of health care coverage (85.5%).
        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking upon the data, it is safe to assume that states with lower poverty levels tends to have better health coverage. 
                            It will be interesting to find out if these states have higher median family income, as it helps with affordable health 
                            coverage and reduction of poverty. Comparing it with the states ranked with highest poverty levels and lack of 
                            health coverage, it is certain that the higher poverty levels play a direct role in lack of health coverage affordability. 
                            Couple of interesting facts from the study, Poverty levels in Mississippi is more than double of New Hampshire 
                            and Lack of health care coverage in Texas is more than 5 times that of Massachusetts.
